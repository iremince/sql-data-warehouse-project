# sql-data-warehouse-project
This project is an implementation of the SQL Data Warehouse project by Baraa, which I followed through a YouTube tutorial. After watching the video, I replicated the project and I'm sharing it here.
This project demonstrates how to build and work with a Data Warehouse structure using SQL for large data analysis and reporting. The project focuses on core SQL commands, data modeling, normalization, and data integration.
